# UOR Mac OS

Ultima Online Renaissance Mac OS Install and useful scripts

This is all basically beta until it isn't. I've tried to make everything non-destructive. Don't blame me if it doesn't work or ruins your whole UO setup. Backup your stuff before you mess around with it :).  

## uor-mac-os-install.sh 

This script will download, install and configure UOR on your Mac. It is fairly basic now, but I plan on adding the automatic install of UOAM 8.3 and some of the UOAM maps and add-ons from UOR like the Geological Survey.

## razor.sh

This will launch another instance of UO from the command line. Instead of trying to use multiple installs and sets of scripts this will allow you to launch as many instances as you want from the command line.

## uoam.sh

This will launch UOAM 8.3. Google the download location of 8.3 and download it. Then download and install Keka (http://www.kekaosx.com/en/), which is a 7-zip unzipping tool for Mac OS. Then download the 8.3 UOAM_install.exe, and unzip it with Keka. Then grab the uoam.EXE from the unzipped uoam_install directory and copy it into the /Applications/Contents/Resources/drive_c/Program Files/UOAM. Rename it to uoam_83.exe. You are all set to run UOAM on your Mac!

I'm planning on automating the installation of UOAM 8.3 in an upcoming version.
